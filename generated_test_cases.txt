Unit Test Case:
1. Test reverseString() with a valid string input (expected output: "olleH")
2. Test reverseString() with an empty string input (expected output: "")
3. Test reverseString() with a string containing special characters (expected output: "!dlroW ,olleH")
4. Test reverseString() with a string containing numbers (expected output: "321cba")
5. Test reverseString() with a string containing only one character (expected output: "a")
6. Test reverseString() with a null input (expected output: null)
7. Test reverseString() with a very long string input (expected output: "dlroW olleH")
